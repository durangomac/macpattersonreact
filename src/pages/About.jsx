      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I grew up in Durango, Colorado — spending winters skiing at Purgatory Resort, summers exploring the mountains, 
        and a huge portion of my childhood either swimming competitively or getting into every bit of technology I could find.
        I graduated from Durango High School in 2001, after years of competitive swimming and performing in theater productions.

        I went on to attend Fort Lewis College, earning my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science Information Systems in the summer of 2004.
        My lifelong love of tech turned into a career that has taken me across aviation, data engineering, and software development.

        Outside of work, I love board games, traveling, cooking, discovering great hole‑in‑the‑wall restaurants, the outdoors, swimming,
        video games, and more recently, oil painting — which I picked up during the pandemic. I also enjoy urban exploring and finding 
        interesting hidden corners of any city I live in.

        After college, I lived in St. George, Utah from July 2007 through December 2014, then Atlanta from December 2014 through April 2016,
        and I&apos;ve been happily rooted in Seattle ever since. No matter where I&apos;ve lived, technology, creativity, and curiosity have always been 
        at the center of who I am.
